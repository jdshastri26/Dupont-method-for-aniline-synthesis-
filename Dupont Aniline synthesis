Explanation

    Load the deSolve and ggplot2 libraries: These libraries are used for solving differential equations and plotting the results, respectively.
    Define initial concentrations: Starting concentrations for nitrobenzene, hydrogen, aniline, and water.
    Define rate constants: Hypothetical rate constant for the reaction.
    Rate equations: Differential equations describing the reaction kinetics, assuming a first-order reaction for simplification.
    Parameters: A list containing the rate constants.
    Time sequence: Time points at which to solve the differential equations.
    Solve ODEs: Using ode function from deSolve to solve the equations.
    Plot the results: Using ggplot2 to visualize the concentrations of reactants and products over time.
